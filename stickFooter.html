<body>
    <main>
        Here is a bunch of text but not enough to push the footer to the
        bottom of the page.
        Take a look at that in the browser, and test it by adding more content into main. You’ll see that when there is
        not enough content, the footer is stuck to the bottom of the viewport. When there is enough, it sits below the
        content.

        This works because our flex property is set to grow where space is available. As our body is a flex container of
        100% minimum height, the main content can grow into all of that available space. Beautiful!

        Changing the source order
        Flexbox has the ability to re-order items. Prior to Flexbox, if you wanted to have something that came after
        something else in the DOM appear before it instead, you were in for a rough time. However, Flexbox makes such
        work trivial. Let’s have a look at how it works.
    </main>
    <footer>
        I'd like this to be at the bottom and thanks to Flexbox I can be
        put in my place!
